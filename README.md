# American Express Industry Project

This project was built as a part of a 24-hour hackathon to provide American Express a solution for their client support model.

The chatbox mimicks the response of an AI chatbot that responds to client inquires.

Inquiries and responses are stored in key value pairs and can be triggered by the keys stored in [Chatbot.js](./src/components/ChatBot/ChatBot.js) when input into the chatbox.
